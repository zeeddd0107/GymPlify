## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works with Expo Go:

1. **For Development Builds:**
   - Get `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
   - Place it in `mobile/google-services.json`
   - Update `app.json` to include `"googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"`
   - Run `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo run:android`

2. **For Production:**
   - Build standalone app with EAS Build
   - Push notifications will continue to work seamlessly

---

## üí° Tips

- Test with a real subscription request flow for the most realistic test
- Keep both web and mobile consoles visible to see the full flow
- Test on both WiFi and mobile data
- Try different notification types if you add more later
