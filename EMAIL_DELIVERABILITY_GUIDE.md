# 📧 Email Deliverability Guide - Prevent OTP Emails from Going to Spam

## ✅ **Already Implemented (Just Deployed)**

### **1. Plain Text Version Added** ✅
Your emails now include both HTML and plain text versions, which significantly improves deliverability with spam filters.

**What changed:**
- All OTP emails now have a plain text fallback
- Spam filters prefer emails with both formats
- Better compatibility with all email clients

---

## 🎯 **Critical Steps You MUST Complete**

### **Step 1: Verify ALL DNS Records in Resend**

1. **Go to:** [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. **Click on:** `gymplify.io`
3. **Check these are ALL GREEN ✅:**
   - ✅ SPF Record
   - ✅ DKIM Record
   - ✅ DMARC Record

### **Step 2: Add DMARC Record (If Not Already Added)**

If DMARC is **NOT** showing green in Resend:

**Go to Hostinger DNS Settings:**
1. Add **TXT Record**:
   - **Type:** `TXT`
   - **Name:** `_dmarc` (or `_dmarc.gymplify.io`)
   - **Value:** `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@gymplify.io`
   - **TTL:** Leave default

2. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for DNS propagation
3. **Go back to Resend** and click "Verify"

### **Step 3: Set Up Return-Path (Recommended)**

This tells email providers where bounces should go:

**In Hostinger DNS:**
- **Type:** `CNAME`
- **Name:** `bounce` (or `bounce.gymplify.io`)
- **Value:** `feedback.resend.com`
- **TTL:** Leave default

### **Step 4: Enable Email Monitoring in Resend**

1. Go to **Resend Dashboard** → **Emails**
2. Monitor your emails for:
   - ✅ Delivery Rate (should be >95%)
   - ✅ Bounce Rate (should be <5%)
   - ✅ Spam Complaints (should be <0.1%)

## 📋 **Best Practices (Ongoing)**

### **1. Warm Up Your Domain (First 2-4 Weeks)**

**Start Slow:**
- Week 1: Send 50-100 emails/day
- Week 2: Send 200-500 emails/day
- Week 3: Send 1,000+ emails/day
- Week 4+: Normal volume

**Why?** Email providers trust domains that gradually increase volume.

### **2. Keep Clean Email Lists**

✅ **Do:**
- Only send to verified email addresses (OTP does this!)
- Remove emails that bounce
- Monitor engagement rates

❌ **Don't:**
- Send to fake/test emails repeatedly
- Send to role-based emails (admin@, support@)
- Ignore bounce notifications

### **3. Monitor Email Reputation**

**Check Your Domain Reputation:**
- [Google Postmaster Tools](https://postmaster.google.com/)
- [Microsoft SNDS](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/)
- [MXToolbox Blacklist Check](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx)

### **4. Optimize Email Content**

✅ **Already Good:**
- Clear subject line
- Professional template
- No spam trigger words
- Proper HTML structure

✅ **Continue to:**
- Keep email size under 100KB
- Use proper formatting
- Include plain text version (done!)
- Avoid too many images

## 🚨 **If Emails Still Go to Spam**

### **1. Ask Users to Whitelist**

**In your app's first OTP screen, show:**
```
📧 Important: Add noreply@gymplify.io to your contacts 
to ensure you receive future codes.
```

### **2. Test with Different Email Providers**

Send test OTPs to:
- Gmail
- Yahoo
- Outlook/Hotmail
- ProtonMail

Check where they land (Inbox vs Spam)

### **3. Use Resend's Deliverability Tools**

**Resend Dashboard → Analytics:**
- Check delivery rates
- Review bounce reasons
- Monitor spam complaints

### **4. Consider Email Warmup Service (If Needed)**

If you're sending high volume (1000+ emails/day):
- [Warmup Inbox](https://www.warmupinbox.com/)
- [Lemlist Email Warmup](https://lemlist.com/email-warmup)
